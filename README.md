# Number TwðŸ’© Movies
## INST 377 Group 32 Final Project

### Project Description
- This application is for recommending 'bad' movies. There are many applications that have 'good' movie recommendations, but fewer options exist to find the 'bad.' The application will give a unique twist to finding new movies to watch. Number TwðŸ’© Movies will recommend movies by rating to ensure the 'worst' movies are being generated for users. General movie ratings will be fixed to be under 50% (or 5/10). For user selectivity, users will be able to set parameters for the type of movie(s) they want to discover (like MPAA rating, genre, language, and runtime). Otherwise, users can click on a button that will take them to a randomly selected 'bad' movie.

### Description of target browsers
- For the target screen sizes, we are targeting both Android devices and PCs, which have screen sizes of 1920px by 1080px (PCs) and 640dp by 480dp (Android). We plan to make our user interface responsive so that it will automatically resize on all devices.
