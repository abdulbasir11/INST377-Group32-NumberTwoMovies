          <h4>Why Number Twüí© Movies?</h4>
          <p><i>Not your average movie app, created by: Abdul-Basir Abdullah, Samantha Dowell, Carl Jeanty, Ye Kim, and Mary Ton.</i></p>
          <p>There are a lack of sites or apps that explicitly recommend bad movies; for people seeking ‚Äúgood‚Äù movie recommendations, there are several sites (e.g., FlickMetrix, Movie of the Night, etc). However, for people seeking ‚Äúbad‚Äù movies recommendations, there are few options.</p>
          <p>A person may want to seek out a ‚Äúbad‚Äù (i.e., low-rated movie) to watch with friends, criticize, or talk and laugh over as opposed to watch seriously. Additionally, film companies could benefit from more attention to negatively reviewed films.</p>
          <p>The system we propose as the solution is a website that takes a ‚Äòunique‚Äô approach to discovering movies. Instead of giving serious recommendations, the site will recommend by ‚Äòlow-rating,‚Äô guaranteeing users the worst movies. Users will not be able to adjust the critical score search parameter; it will be fixed to be below 50% for all movies displayed. However, other search parameters about the movies (such as MPAA rating, genre, and more) will be editable.</p>
          <h4>Who We Are</h4>
          <p>We are a group of students majoring in information sciences and have one thing in common: We enjoy watching movies. Within this commonality, we thought it would be fun to create a search application to find the worst movies!</p>
          <p>Within our web-development class, we chose to create a 'terrible movie' application to test what we have learned. And thus, here we are!</p>
