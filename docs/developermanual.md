# Developer Manual for Number TwðŸ’© Movies

The audience of this document is future developers who will take over Number TwðŸ’© Movies system.

They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about Number TwðŸ’© Movies system design.

We will provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development.

### The API for Number TwðŸ’© Movies server application - all GET, POST, PUT, etc endpoints, and what they each do
- 

### A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development
- On the movie Results page, if the Advanced Search parameters are extremely specific, clicking the 'Show More' button may sometimes show the same movie as an addditional result. This is because only one movie exists in the API for those specific parameters, and the 'Show More' button passes through the API with those same parameters, thus bringing the same movie result.
