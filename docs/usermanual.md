# How Number TwðŸ’© Movies Works
- <p>This application takes a unique approach to discovering movies. Instead of giving 'good movie' recommendations, the site will recommend by â€˜low-rating,â€™ guaranteeing users the worst movies. Users will not be able to adjust the critical score search parameter; it will be fixed to be below 50% for all movies displayed. However, other search parameters about the movies (such as MPAA rating, genre, and more) will be editable.</p>
- <p>The application works with an API (application programming interface) and passes through it depending on either: a single, random search ("Im Feeling Lucky!") or a specific, filtered set of parameters ("Filtered/Advanced Search").</p>
- <p>The API being worked with is the OMDb public database. For this application, the results will be dealing with facets like MPAA rating, Genre, Language, and Runtime.</p>
